# SeabORD

The prototype tool described here (SeabORD) quantifies the fate of displaced and barrieraffected seabirds encountering offshore renewable energy developments (ORDs), significantly 
improving existing methods for estimating the impact of marine developments on breeding 
seabirds. 

Please consult the pdf userguide for details on how to use the application.
